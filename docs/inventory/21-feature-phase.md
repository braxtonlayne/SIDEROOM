# 21 — Feature phase (`BYOS`, and the later prefixes of roadmap-p27)

Waves 27 to 40. Plan, acceptance criteria, agent split and owner needs: [dev/roadmap-p27.md](../dev/roadmap-p27.md) (D-380). Prefixes are those of roadmap-p27 section 4; each wave's integrator adds its items here.

Same conventions as [20-launch-readiness.md](20-launch-readiness.md): an item ticks only when its proof runs (a CI job, a Postgres or browser test, or a recorded run in the integration handoff), never when it is only written. The live Garage cases of `storage.yml` run only on CI; an item ticked on its mock and Postgres proofs says so, and its CI run is linked once the owner pushes.

## Wave 27 — BYOS core
